# Telegram Bot  [@stylizer_bot](https://t.me/stylizer_bot) providing image style transfer using [NST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) & [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) 

Developed as a final project of the Deep Learning Course 1st part by [MIPT](https://mipt.ru) [Deep Learning School](https://dlschool.org).

Currently deployed on Heroku [Free Dyno](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours) so stylizing is quite slow and images in result are not large enough. Also waking the bot up by 1st message may take a couple of minutes.

[Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) model is adopted from [Alexis Jacq](https://github.com/alexis-jacq/Pytorch-Tutorials/blob/d464a69f2e0e892ceed2a1a2cada12a52c180bc5/Neural_Style.py) and rewritten by me.

[CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) model is a binding to the [official implementation](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix).
